# The booking Web App

This is a hotel booking site created to learn more about react and nodeJS. The application uses MongoDB as its database. The idea for the project is from the youtuber "Lama Dev". 

A basic booking web app where users can search for the location they wish to go and search the available hotels and the available rooms in those hotels. The user can then select the days of the booking and the nuumber of people who will be joining the user on their gateaway. The application then leads the user to a specific page which shows images of the hotel and room and the user can confirm the booking. These dates will be stored and will reflect for other users as the other users will not be able to book the same room on previously booked dates. 

There is also an admin site where the admin can check how many users have signed up to the booking app and check how many hotels and rooms are in the database. The admin can also create new users, hotels, and rooms.
